/*
 * This package contains all modules that do not actually have module code, but rather are used as a toggleable feature
 * Ex: The HUD module, which, when toggled, displays the currently activated modules.
 *
 * Every module in here has a reference to the actual class with the logic inside. If one is missing, please report.
 * Logic files are usually in me.constantindev.ccl.mixin
