# Installation

Since so many people ask me how to build this and cant read apparently, I will say the following

**YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUILD IT YOURSELF.
READ [How to obtain the mod without building](https://github.com/AriliusClient/CornClient/wiki/How-to-obtain-the-mod-without-building%3F)
TO DOWNLOAD A PRE-BUILT JAR**
<-- Please make a CI thing or use releases or something -->
Step 1. Install the [fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) 

Step 2. Drag the jar file and the [fabric api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to .minecraft/mods. If there is no mods folder, create one. 

Step 3. Launch fabric using the minecraft launcher. 

If you want to contribute or really build it yourself, [read this](https://github.com/AriliusClient/CornClient/wiki/Building-and-contributing)

## Building
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the new folder in your terminal
3. `./gradlew build`
4. Jarfile will be in build/libs, ccl-(version).jar
<--
## Prebuilds

The prebuilt jarfile can be found in build/libs.

After you obtained the jarfile, put it into your mods folder in your fabric installation for any minecraft version.
Fabric API is needed.-->
